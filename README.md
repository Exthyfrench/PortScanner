# PortScanner
This script will prompt the user to enter a host and port range, then it will scan the host for open ports in the specified range. For each port, it will print whether the port is open or closed.

To use this script, save it to a file (e.g. port_scanner.py) and run it using Python:
-- "python port_scanner.py"
